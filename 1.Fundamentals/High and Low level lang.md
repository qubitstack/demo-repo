**Basically, we as humans understand natural language (NL),while our machine ie the computer, understands only machine language or assembly language,** 
**hence there must be some intermediate/hybrid language which can be understood by both the user and the machine. The high level language(like C++,python**
**,vb,vc++) are used to write understandable code which is then converted into machine code( ie low level languages) which is inturn finally converted into binary** **code and understood by the computer.**
