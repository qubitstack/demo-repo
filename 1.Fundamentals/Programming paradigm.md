# Programming paradigm:-
### Programming paradigm means the style or type of programming.

**The programming paradigms are:-**
* Monolithic Programming (BASIC)
* Procedural/Modular (C)
* Object oriented
* Aspect oriented/Component Assembly

## 1. Monolithic programming:-
### In the early days of computing, programming was thought of as an art, hence in monolithic programming, all lines of code are considered to be a single entity, there are no components of the program and it isnt divisible into smaller units. Hence it was thought of as an art. A single error will affect the entire program.
## 2. Modular/Procedural:-
### In this type of programming, functions were introduced and the entire code was broken down into small components which were called functions, the objective of a function was to reduce code redundancy and increase efficiency.
## 3. Aspect Oriented/Console Assembly:-
