## There are two types of modifiers that we will be dealing with:-
* Unsigned
* Long
## They are called modifiers as they can be used to modify the data types in accordance with our requirements

***Example:- unsigned int can take only positive values, hence its range doesnt contain any negative numbers and therefore its range becomes 0-65535***
***Similarly unsigned char will take the range of 0-255 bytes of space.***

### Long int will take 8 bytes if int takes 4 bytes and long double will take 10 bytes as double takes 8 bytes.
